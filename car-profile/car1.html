          Gateway Classic Cars of Tampa is proud to offer this truly gorgeous 1965 Jaguar E-Type Convertible. This 1965
          E-Type Series 1 for sale is stunning with its blue and red leather interior with a darker Blue convertible
          top. This incredible example of late sixties British sports cars in my option has the sweetest body lines of
          any car, ever! With the long bonnet stretching out in front of you almost beckoning you further down the road,
          it is almost like the car is telling you just one more mile, just one more curve where you hit the apex
          perfectly. The hardest part of owning a car like this is pulling to a stop in your garage and twisting the key
          to shut her down. Tucked under that long bonnet is the original numbers matching 4.2 Liter dual overhead cam
          inline six-cylinder that was an upgrade from the previous 3.8 and mated to the original 4-speed manual
          transmission.
          <br><br>
          The 4.2-litre engine produced the same power as the 3.8-litre 265 bhp and same top speed at 150 mph, but
          increased torque approximately 10% from 240 to 283 lb ft. Acceleration remained pretty much the same and 0 to
          60 mph times were around 6.4 seconds for both engines, but maximum power was now reached at 5,400 rpm instead
          of 5,500 rpm on the 3.8-litre. This meant better throttle response for drivers that did not want to shift down
          gears. The 4.2-litre's block was completely redesigned, made longer to accommodate 5 mm larger bores, and the
          crankshaft modified to use newer bearings. Other engine upgrades included a new alternator/generator and an
          electric cooling fan for the radiator.
          <br><br>
          This E Type for sale has been cared for lovingly and it shows everywhere. The interior is crisp, gauges are
          easy to read with faces that are bright and the glass clean. Once behind the steering wheel of this 1965
          Jaguar for sale your hands just fall into place and by that, I mean shifter and steering wheel are in just
          that right spot! Jaguar E types are in high demand and rightly so, with a limited production of only 9,550
          Roadsters produced from 1965 through 1968. If you do not already have one, then your collection is not
          complete. Here is your chance to put the proverbial cherry on top and this E-Type only has 59,365 actual
          original miles!
          <br><br>
          Options for this '65 Jag E type for sale include: AM radio, Red Leather interior, Seat belts, knock off rims
          that are wrapped in radial tires, and so much more! Notable upgrades worth mentioning are the electronic
          ignition and backup fuel pump! This 1965 Jaguar E-Type Convertible is for sale by our Tampa Showroom and can
          be viewed in greater detail including 100+ HD pictures and an HD video at www.GatewayClassicCars.com. For
