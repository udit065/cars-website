          The Pantera was originally designed by the Italian design firm Ghia by
          American-born designer Tom Tjaarda. The Pantera is a steel unibody design, the first instance of De Tomaso
          using
          this construction technique. An interesting point is the Pantera logo included a version of Argentina's flag
          turned on its side with a T-shaped symbol that was the brand used by De Tomaso's Argentinian cattle ranching
          ancestors. The car debuted in Modena in March 1970 and was presented at the 1970 New York Motor Show a few
          weeks
          later. Approximately a year later the first production Panteras were sold, and production was increased to
          three
          per day. This Pantera is powered by a rebuilt Ford 351 cu in (5.8 L) V8 engine producing a 330 HP. The high
          torque provided by the Ford engine reduces the need for excessive gear changing at low speeds: this makes this
          car much less demanding to drive in urban conditions than many of the locally built competitors products. A ZF
          transaxle is mated to the 351 and allows the Pantera to reach 60 MPH in just 5.5 Seconds. The recently
          serviced
          Power-assisted four-wheel disc brakes and fresh rack and pinion steering were all standard equipment as well.
          If
          you are looking for a true to original car this one would work. It is low miles and is basically an untouched
          original car. The hood has been painted but the rest of the body has the patina you would expect of a 49 year
          old car. The "soft" items such as tires, belts, hoses, some seals, along with the steering rack have been
          replaced due to age. The 351 Cleveland Engine and ZF Transaxle have been rebuilt and a new Clutch has been
          installed. It runs cool, too. This car simply runs and drives very well. This example of a 1971 Pantera
          includes
          its factory tool kit and space saver spare tire with cover. It also has factory headers and an aftermarket
          radio
          is in the dash. The interior is original and correct specifications with the Dash, Seats, Center Console, Door
          Panels and Steering wheel done in leather. This one also comes with lots and lots of receipts and manuals,
          too.
          The A/C was charged, blows ice cold and is ready for summer. Pantera values have been steadily rising and with
          30,000 original miles, this superb example will not last long. Financing also available on any of our
          inventory!
